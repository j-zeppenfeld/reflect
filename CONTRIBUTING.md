# Contributing to Reflect
We love your input, and want to make contributing to this project as easy and
transparent as possible!

The simplest way to contribute is by reporting a bug, proposing a new feature
or by providing general feedback about the current state of the code.

If you want to get involved with the actual coding, we also greatly value your
code contributions through pull requests!

## Pull Requests
To create a pull request, please:

1. Fork the repo and create your development branch from `master`.
2. Make changes in a style consistent with the existing code.
3. Add unit tests for any new features.
4. Update the documentation to reflect changes to the API.
5. Rebase and condense your commits, avoiding merge commits.
   Make sure to sign off all commits for the
   [Developer Certificate of Origin](./DCO).
6. Ensure that all unit tests pass.
7. Push your changes and create a pull request.
